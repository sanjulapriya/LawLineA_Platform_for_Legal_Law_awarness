    sueAmount: "Not fixed, decided by court based on case severity and victim’s dependents",
    explanation: "Section 302 of the Indian Penal Code deals with the act of murder, which is the intentional and unlawful killing of another human being. This is considered one of the gravest offenses under Indian law. The act must be premeditated or done with a clear intent to cause death or such bodily harm that the offender knows will likely cause death. It is distinguishable from culpable homicide not amounting to murder by the presence of greater intent, preparation, or cruelty. This law applies regardless of whether the murder was committed with weapons, poison, or any other method. The intention, motive, and the circumstances under which the act was committed are all analyzed during trial. Indian courts treat this offense with the highest degree of seriousness because it violates the right to life guaranteed under Article 21 of the Constitution. The judgment is based on direct and circumstantial evidence, witness testimony, forensic reports, and the motive behind the act. If found guilty, the accused may be sentenced to life imprisonment or even death, especially in cases of heinous crimes or multiple murders. The law aims to serve justice to the victim and their families while acting as a deterrent to future offenders.",
    howToProceed: "If a person has been murdered, the first step is to immediately contact the nearest police station or call the emergency helpline (100 in India). File an FIR (First Information Report) providing all the details of the incident, including the time, location, possible suspects, and any witnesses. The police will register a case under Section 302 IPC and start the investigation. A postmortem of the victim will be conducted, and all evidence from the scene will be collected. Based on the investigation, the police may arrest the suspect(s). The case will be forwarded to the Magistrate for remand and then tried in a Sessions Court due to the seriousness of the crime. The accused has the right to legal representation, and the victim’s family may also engage a lawyer. During the trial, both the prosecution and defense will present evidence and arguments. If the court finds the accused guilty beyond reasonable doubt, punishment is awarded. The victim’s family can also claim compensation under the Victim Compensation Scheme. Legal aid services are available if the family cannot afford a lawyer. It is crucial to preserve all evidence, provide accurate information, and cooperate with police throughout the process."

    explanation: "Section 153A IPC is meant to stop actions or words that promote enmity between groups based on religion, caste, race, language, or region. It criminalizes speeches, writings, or social media posts that create hatred or disturb public harmony. Even indirect provocation that leads to tension or violence among communities is punishable. The law aims to safeguard India’s secular fabric by penalizing efforts to divide society.
